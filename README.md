r3Ddragon
=========

A WIP Virtual Boy emulator for the 3DS. You can see the current progress [here](https://github.com/mrdanielps/r3Ddragon/wiki/Current-progress). Still needs optimizing.

Notes from NOP90
=========
In this branch I'm working on:
- making a GUI for setting emu options

Created a basic GUI to load roms (with custom icons), pausing games and setting options

ROM Compatibility
=======

At the moment the emulation is very slow (about 5-6 fps) but most of homebrews and some retail roms work perfectly.

- Flappy chip chip (Homebrew) : works fine 
- VUESnake (Homebrew): works fine
- Blox (Homebrew): works fine (some graphic glitches to be solved)
- Wario land: works fine, some sprites not correclty rendered, sometimes crashes with 3D activated during intro 
- Galactic Pinball: seems to work fine, only partially tested.
- Mario Clash: Intro works fine, crashes when game begin.
- Panic bomber: works fine
- Mario's Tennis: seems to work fine
- Red Alarm: crashes after spash screens
- Golf: crashes on boot 
- 3-D Tetris: crashes on boot
